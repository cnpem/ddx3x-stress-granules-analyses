    "text": "Statistical analyses were conducted using Python’s Pingouin library (version 5.5) to evaluate differences between groups. The Mann-Whitney U test was employed to compare group similarities with respect to stress granules area and the count of stress granules per cell, as this non-parametric test is appropriate for assessing differences between two independent groups without assuming normality of data distribution. Statistical significance was determined at a p-value threshold of 0.05, with results reported as median values and interquartile ranges to appropriately represent the distribution of non-normally distributed data (boxplots and violinplots).\n\n\narray(['R326H_GLU-40min', 'R326H_ARS', 'R326H_GLU-20min', 'R326H_CT',\n       'WT_CT', 'WT_ARS', 'WT_GLU-20min', 'WT_GLU-40min'], dtype=object)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeatmap of Mann-Whitney U test results for stress granule area",
